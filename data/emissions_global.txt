EcoRoute Knowledge Base – Global Transport Emissions (2024–2025)

This document contains approximate global average CO₂ emission factors
used for comparing transport modes. Values are indicative ranges based
on international transport and energy studies. Actual emissions vary
by vehicle efficiency, occupancy, and electricity mix.

--------------------------------------------------
PRIVATE ROAD TRANSPORT
(kg CO₂ per vehicle-kilometre)

• Large SUV (Petrol/Diesel): 0.20 – 0.27
• Mid-size Car (Petrol): 0.12 – 0.18
• Small Car / Hatchback: 0.09 – 0.12
• Hybrid Car: 0.07 – 0.10
• Electric Car (global average grid): 0.04 – 0.08
• Motorcycle (<125cc): 0.025 – 0.04

Note:
Electric vehicle emissions depend on electricity generation mix.
Renewable-heavy grids result in significantly lower emissions.

--------------------------------------------------
PUBLIC TRANSPORT
(kg CO₂ per passenger-kilometre)

• Diesel Urban Bus: 0.08 – 0.10
• CNG Bus: 0.05 – 0.07
• Electric Bus: 0.01 – 0.03
• Metro / Subway: 0.009 – 0.015
• Tram / Light Rail: 0.01 – 0.02

Note:
Passenger-kilometre values assume average occupancy levels.

--------------------------------------------------
RAIL TRANSPORT (INTERCITY)
(kg CO₂ per passenger-kilometre)

• Electric High-Speed Rail: 0.006 – 0.02
• Diesel Train: 0.03 – 0.06

--------------------------------------------------
AIR TRANSPORT
(kg CO₂ per passenger-kilometre)

• Domestic / Short-Haul Flight: 0.15 – 0.20
• Economy Class (Short-Haul): 0.12 – 0.15
• Business Class: 0.20 – 0.30

Note:
Aviation emissions are highly sensitive to aircraft type and load factor.

--------------------------------------------------
ACTIVE & LOW-EMISSION TRANSPORT
(kg CO₂ per kilometre)

• Walking: 0.0
• Cycling: 0.0
• E-bike: 0.003 – 0.008

--------------------------------------------------
INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES

• Public transport generally emits significantly less CO₂ per passenger
  than private vehicles.
• Carpooling reduces per-person emissions for private cars.
• Electric transport benefits increase with cleaner electricity grids.
• Walking and cycling are zero-emission at point of use.
